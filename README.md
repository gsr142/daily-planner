The Daily Planner Site is a web application that helps you organize your daily schedule and tasks effectively. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing your time and ensuring you stay on track throughout the day.

## Features
* **Time Block Visualization:** The site displays time blocks for different hours of the day, allowing you to plan your activities from morning to evening.

* **Past, Present, and Future Highlighting:** The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future based on the current hour. This feature helps you quickly identify and prioritize your tasks.

* **Text Saving:** Each time block has an associated text area where you can enter and save your tasks, appointments, or reminders. The site enables you to save the text to the local storage, ensuring that your schedule remains intact even if you refresh the page or close the browser.
